# Ace the Interview: Big-O Notation

This is the first in a new series I'll be working on.
I like to compile relevant notes for specific topics into a single resource for convenience. While I do this, I might as well share with everyone who might appreciate it!

*This is an ongoing project with lots to add, and contributions are welcome. I will probably write a very basic contribution guide shortly if enough people are interested.*

(Sources are appended at the end of the document for further reading.)

Thanks for stopping by! -S
